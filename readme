To clean : make clean

Frist you have to create bin and bin.meta files.
For that do
To make the file : make a1-test.out
To run the file: ./a1-test.out

There was no supplier option in a1-test.cc. So I added the supplier table as 8th option.

once the files are generated the do

To make the file : make main
To run the file: ./main.out

changed the paths in test.cat
these are the paths I used

/home/yagna/Downloads/a5/catalog

/home/yagna/git/tpch-dbgen/



The queries hich I ran are in queries.execute file provided by the professor which I put in the same folder.

The outputs for each query are put as pics labelled from a5-1.png to a5-7.png .

Last but not least I am removing all the bin and bin.meta files for submitting this project as they are large in size.
